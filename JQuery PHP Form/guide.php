          Cayuga street garages for $5.</li>
      <li><span class="question">What should I wear/bring?</span><br/>
          Dress appropriately according to the weather that day. Because there
          is a lot of walking around, browsing, and exploring involved, it is
          best to wear comfortable shoes. You can also bring a water bottle to
          keep yourself hydrated and a bag to carry all the free things you'll
          collect and items you buy!</li>
      <li><span class="question">Should I go? Is this event popular?</span><br/>
          It's become an annual celebration for a reason. We had a turnout of
          over 35,000 people last year!</li>
